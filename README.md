- ### Design
    - #### Colour Scheme
        - The main colours of the title page are black and purple and a hint of light blue. These were chosen to give a sharp contrast and a serious tone as you begin to play what could be an intense guessing game.
        - The game page however, is mainly light blue accompanied by the earlier purple as well as changing to red and green to represent correct and incorrect answers. This aids in the overall vibrancy and sense of achievement or disappointment when you finally guess an answer.
